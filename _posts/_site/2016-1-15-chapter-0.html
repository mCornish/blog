<p>Writing the perfect first sentence is damn near impossible. I’ve written two novels, a handful of short stories, and too many blog posts to count. Each time I started writing, I stared at a blank page for several minutes before conceding to the fact that, no, I still hadn’t figured out a way to avoid fudging my opening sentence the first time I write it.</p>

<p>For me, web development is the exact same way. Starting a project from scratch is by far the most intimidating part of the whole process. Even though I know I’ll end up rewriting and refactoring my code, my brain tells me that I’ve got to figure out everything before I can even begin. Why? The hell if I know. Ironically, brains can be very stupid.</p>

<p>I created this blog 7 months ago. Before that, I played with the idea of creating a dev blog for at least a month. You’ll notice that, 2/3 of a year after my brain gave birth to the original idea, it’s just now deciding to really do something about it.</p>

<p><strong>“Why are you blaming your brain? <em>You</em> control your brain. You can’t fool me!”</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I thought I was alone here, so you’re sudden outburst startled the shit out of me. Secondly, I’m not trying to fool anyone. Think about it: How often do you <em>want</em> to do something, but not <em>actually</em> do it? Hmm, doesn’t sound like you’re in complete control, now <em>does</em> it?</p>

<p><strong>“But who is controlling my brain if not me? If I’m not my brain, what am I? What does it mean to be me? WHAT IS LIFE?”</strong></p>

<p>Woah. Woah. Take a breath. There will be plenty of time for existential question in later chapters. This chapter is simply an introduction. As you can see, I’m trying out a different format from other web dev blogs. I’ve got two reason for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gimmicks motivate me</li>
  <li>I haven’t figured out what I’m trying to accomplish</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m hoping that, as I refine this format, it will become more clear what exactly I want to achieve with this blog. This is definitely a rough start (meta posts are pointless when you don’t have an audience), but that’s the whole idea of this chapter. It’s a beginning, and beginnings are rough. Every. Single. Time.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just have to suck it up, tell your brain to take a coffee break, and just do the damn the thing.</p>

<p><strong>I’m Mike Cornish. This is devStory. Let’s just do the damn thing.</strong></p>
