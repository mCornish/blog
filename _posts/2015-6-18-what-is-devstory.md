title: devStory is Exactly What I've Been Looking For
---

I've considered myself a web developer for a few years now. I've been a blogger for a few years longer than that. For some stupid reason, I've never thought to combine the two.

I'm neither a great developer nor a great blogger. My understanding of web technology is satisfactory at best; I know what I need to know to get the job done. I can make you a nice looking website and get it online, but don't ask me to explain how exactly your hosting works or why I used one Javascript technology over another. Similarly, I can run a blog that, in time, people will read, but I can count on one hand the number of posts I've written that I'm actually proud of.

To get better at something, you have to do it. I've always been a firm believer in learning through experience. Recently, however, I've also seen the value in learning through _sharing_ experiences. It's much easier to gain a practical understanding of a topic when you know someone else is depending on you to help them understand it too.
