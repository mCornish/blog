title: Why Web Developers are also Storytellers
---

If you don't know how to tell a story, you're losing an extra step you can have above your competition. Storytelling is everywhere. Authors aren't the only ones telling stories. Marketers tells stories to consumers. Musicians tell stories to anyone who listens to their music. Lawyers tell stories to juries. However, this isn't a blog for marketers or musicians, and certainly not lawyers. This is a blog for web developers, and we tell stories too.

# Get a Job
Most of us have been here. If you have, you probably already remember some of the stories you had to tell to even have a chance at getting paid.

It starts with your resume or CV. You could just scribble down every job or project you've ever done, including your summer as a lifeguard and your high school chemistry report that you got an A+ on, but why the hell would you do that? It makes why more sense to tell potential employers about the app you built or your time working for a technical agency. Why? Because you're telling the story of a web developer.

One of the most important parts of storytelling is taking out all of the junk that doesn't matter. The _Harry Potter_ books don't go into detail on muggle life because the stories are about wizards (and muggles are boring). Movies are entertaining because that cut out hours of detail that take away from the main story. Similarly, web developers have to narrow the focus of their own story in order to get hired.

The more focused your story, the better. Maybe you like to work with Javascript, Node, PHP, SQL, Python, and even some C++. That's great, but that's a lot of subjects to try to cover in a short introduction (which may be all you get before an employer passes you up). You don't _have_ to specialize, but you'll be more useful if you do, and your story will be much easier to tell.

# Find the Right Tools
There is an infinite number of ways to tell a story. Most of those ways are wrong. It's the job of the storyteller to determine which option is the best.

_Harry Potter_ could have been dark and gritty, but it's a series for a young audience. _Game of Thrones_ could cut out the violence, but then it wouldn't be the same, ruthless story that it is.
