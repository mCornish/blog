## I'll be a blogger (again)
After reading [this post](http://alistapart.com/column/write-what-you-know-now?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-194&utm_medium=email), I was motivated to start blogging about development/design. I've had several blogs in the past, so I'm not stranger to this world. However, I don't consider myself an authority on development or design, so I've been reluctant. The plan is to keep this going throughout the year and, ideally, make it into something useful.

## I'll know how to use JS promises
I've never used a promise. Not even once. I'd be ashamed, but I'm honestly not sure how embarrassing this should be.

## I'll have a collection of UI/react components
I envy great UI designers. I made and remade dozens of UI components last year. I plan on doing that much less as time goes on. I'm still learning React, so these components may or may not be of the React variety, but I'm optimistic.

## I'll have written a JS library
I won't feel legit until my Github page boasts at least one original library. I have no idea what it will be, but I have a whole year to figure that out.

## I'll be a professional
I've done paid internships in the past, but I want to do this for real. To me, that doesn't necessarily mean being hired at a company. Ideally, I'll be working as a freelancer, which brings me to my final point.

## I'll be a business owner
Being a freelancer means being a business owner. I find that fact both intimidating and exciting. I also have a long-time project that I'll be finishing up next year and hopefully turning into a business.
