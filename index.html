        <p>I’ve been chasing my passion since I was a child. In elementary school, I was a compulsive writer, forcing my teachers to comment on every nonsensical short story I wrote. When I got home from school, I would walk up the hill to my best friend’s house and he would illustrate comic books as I wrote the plot. In middle school, I became obsessed with creating music. I was a top clarinet player in our school band, and I begged my mother buy me a keyboard, then a guitar, then an electric guitar, then a bass guitar. In high school, I started at least 5 different blogs. By the time I reached college, I was addicted to web development.</p>

I’ve had several blogs in the past, so I’m not stranger to this world. However, I don’t consider myself an authority on development or design, so I’ve been reluctant.

However, this isn’t a blog for marketers or musicians, and certainly not lawyers. This is a blog for web developers, and we tell stories too.</p>
