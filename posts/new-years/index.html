After reading this post, I was motivated to start blogging about development/design. I’ve had several blogs in the past, so I’m not stranger to this world. However, I don’t consider myself an authority on development or design, so I’ve been reluctant. The plan is to keep this going throughout the year and, ideally, make it into something useful.

        <h2 id="ill-be-a-blogger-again">I’ll be a blogger (again)</h2>
<p>After reading <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/write-what-you-know-now?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&amp;utm_campaign=Issue-194&amp;utm_medium=email">this post</a>, I was motivated to start blogging about development/design. I’ve had several blogs in the past, so I’m not stranger to this world. However, I don’t consider myself an authority on development or design, so I’ve been reluctant. The plan is to keep this going throughout the year and, ideally, make it into something useful.</p>

<h2 id="ill-know-how-to-use-js-promises">I’ll know how to use JS promises</h2>
<p>I’ve never used a promise. Not even once. I’d be ashamed, but I’m honestly not sure how embarrassing this should be.</p>

<h2 id="ill-have-a-collection-of-uireact-components">I’ll have a collection of UI/react components</h2>
<p>I envy great UI designers. I made and remade dozens of UI components last year. I plan on doing that much less as time goes on. I’m still learning React, so these components may or may not be of the React variety, but I’m optimistic.</p>

<h2 id="ill-have-written-a-js-library">I’ll have written a JS library</h2>
<p>I won’t feel legit until my Github page boasts at least one original library. I have no idea what it will be, but I have a whole year to figure that out.</p>

<h2 id="ill-be-a-professional">I’ll be a professional</h2>
<p>I’ve done paid internships in the past, but I want to do this for real. To me, that doesn’t necessarily mean being hired at a company. Ideally, I’ll be working as a freelancer, which brings me to my final point.</p>

<h2 id="ill-be-a-business-owner">I’ll be a business owner</h2>
<p>Being a freelancer means being a business owner. I find that fact both intimidating and exciting. I also have a long-time project that I’ll be finishing up next year and hopefully turning into a business.</p>
